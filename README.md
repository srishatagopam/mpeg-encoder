# mpeg-encoder
MPEG encoder and decoder framework that showcases many image processing techniques; namely frame sub/up-sampling,  image/video compression, and motion estimation. This project
was originally written in MATLAB, so I decided to rewrite it in Python as an exercise and to get used to image processing packages, such as cv2.
